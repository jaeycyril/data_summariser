## DATA SUMMARISER (WIP)

This library was created to simply provide a quick scan of datasets.

Further analysis can then be done using any of the other myriad packages out there.

### Using the Container

Make sure you have Docker installed.

```
docker build -t data_summariser .
docker run -it data_summariser
```

You can then import and try out the package.
